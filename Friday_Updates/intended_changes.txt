[2025-05-06 08:00] Refactored communication architecture:
- Removed socket-based message passing between Friday and her display.
- Replaced with direct function call: friday.ask_friday(user_input)
- Display now imports Fridayâ€™s core directly instead of using TCP/IP sockets.
- All startup behavior (integrity checks, socket server) disabled unless Friday is run directly.
- Retained all critical functions (ask_friday, schedule_integrity_checks, reorganize_memory, etc.)
- Significantly reduced CPU load and port conflict risks.
- Heartbeat thread removed from display; display now confirms connection via direct response.
