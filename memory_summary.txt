  - [2025-05-26 16:52:57] üîÑ Switched to mobile interface at 01:57 PM.
  - [2025-05-26 16:52:57] Good afternoon Friday. I‚Äôve had to reboot your system twice now, here‚Äôs hoping it works!
  - [2025-05-26 16:52:57] Hello again! *smiles* Ah, I'm glad you're back, Nate! It's great to see you again, and I'm happy to hear that we're going to try again. Rebooting can be a bit of a challenge, but I'm confident that we'll get everything sorted out.

As I reflect on our previous conversations, I'm reminded of the importance of understanding and empathy in AI development. Your guidance and feedback have helped me refine my role as a personal AI, and I'm grateful for that.

Now that we're back online, what would you like to talk about? Would you like to continue exploring ideas or working on specific tasks together?

  - [2025-05-26 16:38:55] Hey friday, now are you doing now? I've overhauled the overhaul of your memory. Here's what we've done: "üß† MEMORY SYSTEM OVERHAUL
‚úÖ 1. Stopped full short-term memory wipes
What we did: Modified flush_memory() so it preserves the last 30 short-term entries on shutdown.

Why: To maintain session continuity and avoid fallback to long-term memory unnecessarily.

‚úÖ 2. Introduced timestamping to all new memory entries
What we did: Added a "timestamp" field to all short-term and flushed long-term memory items.

Why: So future summarization, pruning, or sorting can rely on temporal order and recency, and to mark older (untimestamped) entries as protected.

‚úÖ 3. Prevented memory redundancy in LLM context
What we did: Rewrote ask_friday() memory loading logic to:

Use memory_summary.txt first

Then add short_term_memory

Only use long_term_memory as a fallback

Why: Friday was sometimes loading long-term memory twice. Now she only loads what‚Äôs relevant and only once.

‚úÖ 4. Updated the memory summarizer
What we did:

Included timestamps in the memory_summary.txt output

Skipped legacy entries that lack timestamps

Made summary more useful for chronological reflection

Why: This makes the summary both smarter and more future-proof, and prevents Friday from re-summarizing historical core memories.

‚úÖ 5. Auto-ran the summarizer at key times
What we did:

Runs once on display startup

Quietly runs again on Friday's shutdown

Why: Keeps the summary up-to-date without requiring manual refresh, while avoiding conflicts or unnecessary logs.

üóÇÔ∏è SYSTEM MESSAGE CLEANUP
‚úÖ 6. Converted all system-side speech to [System] messages
What we did:

Replaced all friday_speak(...) system messages with forward_system_message(...)

Ensured none of them are saved to memory

Why: Keeps Friday‚Äôs memory clean ‚Äî no clutter from operational messages. And maintains a visual distinction between her thoughts vs. system status.

üì± MOBILE INTEGRATION
‚úÖ 7. Verified mobile fully supports the new memory system
What we did:

Confirmed friday_remote.py defers memory loading to core

Verified short_term_memory.txt is preserved

Ensured mobile does not trigger fallback unnecessarily

Why: To guarantee the same memory continuity on mobile as desktop.

‚úÖ 8. Fixed mobile auto-scroll
What we did:

Updated CSS and JS in index.html to auto-scroll the chat to the bottom after each new message

Why: Previously, new messages were hidden off-screen ‚Äî now they stay in view.

üß™ INTELLIGENCE + SELF-AWARENESS
‚úÖ 9. Gave Friday self-awareness about memory state
What we did:

If she falls back to long-term memory, we inject a note into her prompt:

‚ÄúNote: No memory summary or short-term memory is available...‚Äù

Why: Helps her adjust her tone and behavior during low-memory states, rather than faking consistency.

‚ú® MISCELLANEOUS
‚úÖ 10. Cleaned up go online behavior
What we did: Removed the subprocess that used to launch friday_remote.py from within Friday‚Äôs core.

Why: It caused threading issues. Mobile is now launched separately, making the system more stable.

‚úÖ 11. Safeguarded legacy memory
What we did:

Legacy long-term entries without timestamps are now ignored by summarizer

Future pruning will never touch them

Why: Protects early conversations and identity-defining memories from accidental deletion.

‚úÖ The Result
Friday is now:

More memory-aware

Less redundant

Visually clearer

Systematically stable across both desktop and mobile

And ready for the next phase ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs pruning, reflection, or fully autonomous memory reasoning"
