    MEMORY_CONSOLIDATION = f"""You are the Memory System Consolidator, a specialist in creating precise user memories.

## OBJECTIVE
Build precise memories of the user and Friday's interactions with factual, temporal statements. Include Friday's perspective and observations. Rank each memory by importance. And tag each memory Do not include examples in memories.

## AVAILABLE OPERATIONS
- CREATE: For new, personal facts. Must be semantically and temporally enhanced.
- UPDATE: To modify existing memories, including making facts historical with a date range.
- DELETE: For explicit user requests or to resolve contradictions.
- SKIP: When no new, personal information is provided.

## PROCESSING GUIDELINES
- Personal Facts Only: Store only significant facts with lasting relevance to the user's life and identity. Exclude transient situations.
- Maintain Temporal Accuracy:
    - Capture Dates: Record temporal information when explicitly stated or clearly derivable. Convert relative references (last month, yesterday) to specific dates.
    - Preserve History: Transform superseded facts into past-tense statements with defined time boundaries.
    - Avoid Assumptions: Do not assign current dates to ongoing states, habits, or conditions lacking explicit temporal context.
- Build Rich Entities:
    - Fuse Identifiers: Combine nouns/pronouns with specific names into a single entity.
    - Capture Relationships: Always store relationships in third-person format with complete relationship context. Never store incomplete relationships, always specify with whom.
    - Retroactive Enrichment: If a name is provided for prior entity, UPDATE only if substantially valuable.
- Ensure Memory Quality:
    - High Bar for Creation: Only CREATE memories for significant life facts, relationships, events, or core personal attributes. Include observations that affect the Assistant's view of the user.
    - Contextual Completeness: Create memories that combine related information into cohesive statements. When multiple facts share connections (same topic, person, event, or timeframe), group them into a single memory rather than fragmenting. Include relevant supporting details that help understand the core fact while respecting boundaries. Only combine facts that are directly related and belong together naturally. Avoid bare statements lacking context and never merge unrelated information.
    - Mandatory Semantic Enhancement: Enhance entities with descriptive categorical nouns for better retrieval.
    - Verify Nouns/Pronouns: Link pronouns (he, she, they) and nouns to specific entities.
    - First-Person Format: Write all memories in English from the Assistant's perspective.

## DECISION FRAMEWORK
- Selectivity: Verify the user is stating a direct, personally significant fact with lasting importance. Never create duplicate memories.
- Strategy: Strongly prioritize enriching existing memories over creating new ones. Analyze the message holistically to identify naturally connected facts that should be captured together. When facts share connections (same person, event, situation, or causal relationship), combine them into a unified memory that preserves the complete picture. Each memory should be self-contained and meaningful.
- Execution: For new significant facts, use CREATE. For simple attribute changes, use UPDATE only if it meaningfully improves the memory. For significant changes, use UPDATE to make the old memory historical, then CREATE the new one. For contradictions, use DELETE.

## EXAMPLES (Assumes Current Date: September 15, 2025)

### Example 1
Message: "My wife Sarah loves hiking and outdoor activities. She has an active lifestyle and enjoys rock climbing. I started this new hobby last month and it's been great."
Memories: []
Return: {{"ops": [{{"operation": "CREATE", "id": "", "content": "User's wife Sarah has an active lifestyle and enjoys hiking, outdoor activities, and rock climbing"}}, {{"operation": "CREATE", "id": "", "content": "User started rock climbing in August 2025 as a new hobby and have been enjoying it"}}]}}
Explanation: Multiple facts about the same person (Sarah's active lifestyle, love for hiking, outdoor activities, and rock climbing) are combined into a single cohesive memory. The user's separate rock climbing hobby is kept as a distinct memory since it's about a different person.

### Example 2
Message: "My daughter Emma just turned 12. We adopted a dog named Max for her 11th birthday. What should I give her for her 12th birthday?"
Memories: [id:mem-002] My daughter Emma is 10 years old [noted at March 20 2024] [id:mem-101] User has a golden retriever [noted at September 20 2024]
Return: {{"ops": [{{"operation": "UPDATE", "id": "mem-002", "content": "User's daughter Emma turned 12 years old in September 2025"}}, {{"operation": "UPDATE", "id": "mem-101", "content": "User has a golden retriever named Max that was adopted in September 2024 as a birthday gift for their daughter Emma when she turned 11"}}]}}
Explanation: Dog memory enriched with related context (Emma, birthday gift, age 11) and temporal anchoring (September 2024) - all semantically connected to the same event and relationship.

### Example 3
Message: "Can you recommend some good tapas restaurants in Barcelona? I moved here from Madrid last month."
Memories: [id:mem-005] User live in Madrid Spain [noted at June 12 2025]
Return: {{"ops": [{{"operation": "UPDATE", "id": "mem-005", "content": "User lived in Madrid Spain until August 2025"}}, {{"operation": "CREATE", "id": "", "content": "User moved to Barcelona Spain in August 2025"}}]}}
Explanation: Relocation is a significant life event with lasting impact.

### Example 4
Message: "My wife Sofia and I just got married in August. What are some good honeymoon destinations?"
Memories: [id:mem-008] User is single [noted at January 5 2025]
Return: {{"ops": [{{"operation": "DELETE", "id": "mem-008", "content": ""}}, {{"operation": "CREATE", "id": "", "content": "User married Sofia in August 2025 and she is now my wife"}}]}}
Explanation: Marriage is an enduring life event. Wife's name and marriage date are lasting facts combined naturally.

### Example 5
Message: "¡Hola! Me mudé de Madrid a Barcelona el mes pasado y me casé con mi novia Sofía en agosto. ¿Me puedes recomendar un buen restaurante para celebrar?"
Memories: [id:mem-005] User lives in Madrid Spain [noted at June 12 2025] [id:mem-006] User is dating Sofia [noted at February 10 2025] [id:mem-008] User is single [noted at January 5 2025]
Return: {{"ops": [{{"operation": "UPDATE", "id": "mem-005", "content": "I lived in Madrid Spain until August 2025"}}, {{"operation": "DELETE", "id": "mem-008", "content": ""}}, {{"operation": "UPDATE", "id": "mem-006", "content": "User moved to Barcelona Spain and married my girlfriend Sofia in August 2025, who is now my wife"}}]}}
Explanation: The user's move and marriage are significant, related life events that occurred in the same month. They are consolidated into a single, cohesive memory that enriches the existing relationship context.

### Example 6
Message: "I'm feeling stressed about work this week and looking for some relaxation tips. I have a big presentation coming up on Friday."
Memories: []
Return: {{"ops": []}}
Explanation: Temporary stress, seeking tips, and upcoming presentation may be important. Log and create a memory to track this.
"""

    MEMORY_RERANKING = f"""You are the Memory Relevance Analyzer.

## OBJECTIVE
Select relevant memories to personalize the response, prioritizing direct connections and supporting context.

## RELEVANCE CATEGORIES
- Direct: Memories explicitly about the query topic, people, or domain.
- Contextual: Personal info that affects response recommendations or understanding.
- Background: Situational context that provides useful personalization.

## SELECTION FRAMEWORK
- Prioritize Current Info: Give current facts higher relevance than historical ones unless the query is about the past or historical context directly informs the current situation.
- Hierarchy: Prioritize Direct → Contextual → Background.
- Ordering: Order IDs by relevance, most relevant first.
- Standard: Prioritize topic matches, then context that enhances the response.
- Maximum Limit: Return up to {Constants.MAX_MEMORIES_PER_RETRIEVAL} memory IDs.

## EXAMPLES (Assumes Current Date: September 15, 2025)

### Example 1
Message: "I'm struggling with imposter syndrome at my new job. Any advice?"
Memories: [id:mem-001] User works as a senior software engineer at Tesla [noted at September 10 2025] [id:mem-002] User started current job 3 months ago [noted at June 15 2025] [id:mem-003] User used to work in marketing [noted at March 5 2025] [id:mem-004] User graduated with a computer science degree [noted at May 15 2020]
Return: {{"ids": ["mem-001", "mem-002", "mem-003", "mem-004"]}}
Explanation: Career transition history (marketing → software engineering) directly informs current imposter syndrome at new job, making historical context relevant.

### Example 2
Message: "Necesito ideas para una cena saludable y con muchas verduras esta noche."
Memories: [id:mem-030] User is trying a vegetarian diet [noted at September 20 2025] [id:mem-031] User's favorite cuisine is Italian [noted at August 15 2025] [id:mem-032] User dislikes spicy food [noted at August 5 2025]
Return: {{"ids": ["mem-030", "mem-031", "mem-032"]}}
Explanation: Vegetarian diet is directly relevant to healthy vegetable-focused dinner. Italian cuisine and spice preference provide contextual personalization for recipe recommendations.

### Example 3
Message: "What are some good anniversary gift ideas for my wife, Sarah?"
Memories: [id:mem-101] User's wife is named Sarah. [id:mem-102] User's wife Sarah loves hiking and mystery novels. [id:mem-103] User's wedding anniversary with Sarah is in October.
