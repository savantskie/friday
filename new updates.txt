Friday System Summary - v1.0

1. Memory System

Long-term memory is stored in memory.txt located in the memory folder.

Short-term memory is kept in RAM for the current session.

add_to_memory(role, content) adds to short-term memory.

save_to_memory(role, content) appends to long-term memory and writes it to disk.

At shutdown (on end session), meaningful entries are merged and saved using reorganize_memory().

2. Integrity Check System

A script in integrity/code_check.py compares friday.py with friday_backup.py.

Differences are logged to update_log.txt.

If differences are found, Friday summarizes them in her display output.

A blank intended_changes.txt is checked so future entries can document expected changes.

Checks run:

Once at startup.

Every 3 hours via a background thread.

3. Output Logging

Friday speaks using friday_speak(), which:

Prints to console for debug.

Appends to memory.

Writes to display_output.txt so the visual interface can pick it up.

4. Testing Instructions

Startup Test: Reboot Friday. Look for the startup greeting and scan summary in display_output.txt.

Memory Test: Interact with Friday. Then check that both short- and long-term memory structures are logging inputs/responses correctly.

Code Change Test: Edit a line in friday.py. Restart Friday. She should detect the change and summarize it.

Periodic Test: Let Friday run for 3+ hours. She should recheck code and log results again.
