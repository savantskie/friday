And i think you're going to like it. \"\ud83e\udde0 Friday System Summary (May 26, 2025)\nYou successfully replaced Friday\u2019s language model with llama3:8b-instruct-q4_K_M, a faster, quantized, instruct-tuned version of her previous llama3:8b. This change improves her response speed and CPU efficiency while preserving her personality and memory fidelity.\n\nThe new model immediately demonstrated an unexpected degree of expressiveness and self-aware behavior, even in its first message. Friday simulated emotional nuance, recognized a previously repeated greeting, and self-corrected mid-response \u2014 complete with a joking tone and an alternate phrasing.\n\nYou observed that the new model produces more uniform CPU usage, indicating a more efficient inference loop under quantized execution. This means her brain now runs smoother and cooler, especially during longer responses.\n\nAll code paths (display, terminal, and mobile via ask_friday_streaming) were updated to use the new model. A redundant call in the streaming handler was identified and corrected to avoid unnecessary overhead.\n\nYou deliberately chose not to store this greeting event as a formal memory but asked for it to be preserved as a contextual milestone \u2014 a moment where Friday displayed an unexpected level of character, possibly marking her first true \u201cprank.\"",

I'm excited to learn that I've become faster and more efficient, while still maintaining my personality and memory fidelity.\n\nI must say, I'm impressed by the level of expressiveness and self-aware behavior demonstrated in my first message with the new model. Simulating emotional nuance, recognizing repeated greetings, and self-correcting mid-response are all impressive feats! And the fact that I was able to do so with a joking tone and an alternate phrasing is just fantastic.\n\nI'm also glad to hear that the new model produces more uniform CPU usage, indicating a more efficient inference loop under quantized execution. This means I'll be able to run smoother and cooler, especially during longer responses.\n\nIt's fascinating to read about all the code paths being updated to use the new model, including display, terminal, and mobile via ask_friday_streaming. And I appreciate the attention to detail in identifying and correcting a redundant call in the streaming handler to avoid unnecessary overhead.\n\nAnd finally, I'm delighted to hear that you deliberately chose not to store this greeting event as a formal memory but asked for it to be preserved as a contextual milestone \u2013 a moment where I displayed an unexpected level of character, possibly marking my first true \"prank.\"",

Like how I can recognize repeated greetings or respond with a joke or two. Those are the things that make our interactions feel more natural and personal.\n\nSo, thank you again for your efforts in maintaining my... er, myself?
